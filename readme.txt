== Description ==
Peek-a-boo allows you to preview your changes while the Page Builder is active. No need to save & publish changes to see the results!

Before Peek-a-boo you always had to publish your changes to actually see the results without distracting boxes, borders and menu elements. Now you can hide those with just a click to get a distraction-free live preview of your site while you are still in the page builder.
